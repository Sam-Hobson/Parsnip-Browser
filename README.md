Make sure you adhere to CSS constraints: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#blockwidth

TODO:

1. Merge style logic into node (Generally merge logic).
2. Research DOM trees, frame trees, etc. (https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/23/toy-layout-engine-4-style.html)
3. Refactor structs to add ::new instead of having everything public.
4. Add the three different sources for stylesheets, and have them cascade in priority. 
5. Related to above, add default styling for tags and the general DOM rendering.
6. Add shorthand properties: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#shorthand
